== Questions and answers

=== Networking

==== How do I enable access to the RMI interface for clients when the kernel is running on a host with multiple IP addresses?

See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/faq.html#netmultihomed.

==== When developing a vehicle driver, which side (driver or vehicle) should be the client/server?

This should be decided based on project-specific requirements.
You are free to implement it either way.
